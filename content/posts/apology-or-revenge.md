  "I wish I had been more thoughtful. I know my words hurt you. I should have never spoken that way to someone I love and respect. I'll do my best to think before I speak in the future." I said.

She replied, "Apology accepted"

Then, She added," You will not change🙂"

But, She didn't know I asked for her apology from core of my heart. Ik, I did wrong, I understood it.  Then, I started to ignoring her, reduced the ratio of saying 'Sorry'. Magically, Everything turn 180 degree🙂🤣



Thanks, X
